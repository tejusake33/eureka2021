        Technologies in Food Processing :</h3> <br>
    <h4 class="head" style="color: purple;">1]New sensors can detect bacterial contamination of packaged foods:</h4>
    <h5 style="color: red;">Wondering if that chicken in the fridge is still good?</h5>
    <p>Sensors in packaging could soon alert you of dangerous bacteria in various types of food products.Chemical
        engineer, Carlos Filipe, at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, has developed sensors to detect the
        presence of the potentially dangerous bacteria, E. coli, in packaged foods.
        To do so, Filipe and his team coated a flexible film in molecules that glow in the presence of E. coli. The
        sensors glow around molecules that E. coli cells produce, so the material doesn’t have to touch contaminated
        food to know that the bacteria is there. <br>
    <h4 class="head" style="color:purple ;">2) How a micro-needle detects contamination in packaged food:</h4>
    <p>MIT's new food sensor can now pierce through food packages and detect signs of spoilage or contamination. The
        velcro-like sensor is made with silk micro-needles that can scan through plastic package, Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology (MIT) said in a statement.

        <img src="thermal.png" alt="" srcset="" width="300px">
    </div>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">1.1) Radio frequency heating:</h5>
    <p >Radio frequency heating (dielectric heating) is a process by which a high-frequency radio wave is created using a
        generator for heating a dielectric material. Heat is quickly generated in the center of the food .
        Each food product has specific dielectric properties, and these depend on the viscosity, temperature, chemical
        composition, and other physiological properties of the food . It is applied in the food industry for continuous
        and batch heat processes ; rapid defrosting of frozen fish, meat, and other processed materials or foodstuff ;
        baking, disinfecting, and sanitizing dry food products (seeds, cereals, dried fruits, legumes); and sterilizing
        solid or viscous packaged foods .
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">1.2 )Microwave heating:</h5>
    <p>Microwave heating is a thermal process that is performed with electromagnetic microwave radiation (1–100 GHz) and
        heat transfer. Any food that is exposed to the microwave is heated due to the electric and magnetic fields that
        generate heat .
        The dielectric and magnetic properties of foods influence microwave activity. Due to the presence of water,
        microwave-treated liquid foods absorb electromagnetic energy very quickly .
        Foods heat faster outside than indoors. Microwave heating is not uniform and results in nutrient losses due to
        the high temperature of the heated surface .
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">1.3 )Ohmic heating:</h5>
    <p>Ohmic heating is a process of Joule heating, electro-heating, or electro-conductive heating. Electricity flows
        through the food. This process compared to microwave and radio frequency heating has no penetration depth
        limitation. The heating is carried out evenly, without damaging the nutrients in the food .
        Ohmic heating’s applied products are for liquid foods containing large particles: slices of fruit in syrups and
        sauces, stews, soups, and heat-sensitive liquids .
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">1.4)Infrared heating:</h5>
    <p>The infrared process is between the ultraviolet energy region and the microwave. Infrared radiation is normally
        classified based on its spectral spectrum, in near-infrared (700–1400 nm), mid-infrared (1400–3000 nm), and
        far-infrared (3000–10,000 nm) regions .
        The far infrared is considered to be the most useful region for food processing, as most food components are
        absorbed by radiation in this region . Infrared heating is an indirect way of heat. At this stage
        electromagnetic energy enters food, adsorbs to the surface, and then converts to heat .Heating by radiant energy
        depends on the characteristics and color of the food.

    <h4 class="head" style="color:purple ;">3]Non-Thermal technologies:</h4>
    <div class="right">
        <img src="non thermal.png" alt="" srcset="">
    </div>
    <p>The term “nonthermal processing” is very often used to describe efficient processes at ambient or sublethal
        temperatures .
        Developing and optimizing the processes of novel food preservation have become a major trend in food processing
        nowadays. Thus, those used to obtain minimally processed foods stand out alongside the ones based on emerging
        physical techniques (high-pressure processing, pulsed electric field processing, cold plasma treatment,
        ultrasound processing, irradiation, UV and pulsed light). These processes enable engineers and scientists to
        produce more nutritive, fresher, less processed, and safer foods .</p>

    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">2.1)High-pressure processing:</h5>
    <p>High hydrostatic pressure was first used in Japan in the 1990s. It has been improved over the years and is now
        used worldwide. It’s basically a cold pasteurization, which is traditionally used in the destruction and
        inactivation of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms while preserving the quality of food. This technology is
        an energy-efficient and rapidly acting technological aid used in today’s food processing . The aim of this
        process is to extract a considerable amount of bioactive compounds from foods and the enhancement of their
        bioavailability . </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">2.2)Pulsed electric field processing:</h5>
    <p>This technique uses high-intensity pulsed electric field and involves pulses of high voltage (typically 20–80
        kV/cm), for short periods of time (less than 1 second), which pass through the product placed between a set of
        electrodes inside a chamber, which are applied to fluid foods.
        This main microbial process is used in order to inactivate some enzymes. It is also used to reduce the heating
        time of foods, and thus the degradation in the sensory and physical properties of foods is minimized .
        Pulsed electric field has been used in several processes: food processing, bio-processing, inactivation of
        microorganisms, or permeabilization of food cells without thermal effects.
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">2.3)Cold plasma treatment:</h5>
    <p>Cold plasma is considered a modern technology, with nonthermal activity, which has been used in food processing
        in microbial inactivation and in the decontamination of products from the food industry. This technology has
        been used because the energy consumption is lower and the demands on temperature are lower when compared to
        conventional processing methods .
        The cold plasma processing system is supported by a ceramic electrode and a high-frequency plasma generator .
    </p>
    <h5 style="color: palevioletred;">2.4)Irradiation:</h5>
    <p>Radiation is a process used to conserve food. This is a nonthermal process that lowers or eliminates
        microorganisms and does not destroy the properties of food. This process is considered by 55 countries to be
        safe if 1 of the 3 approved irradiation processes is used: gamma rays, X-rays, or electron beams .
        Gamma or X-rays rapidly enter food and inactivate microorganisms. They are high-frequency waves; they do not
        generate heat and thus the quality of the food remains intact .
