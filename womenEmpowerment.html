        scope for women entrepreneurs in food processing sector’</h1> <br>
    <p>Entrepreneurs should be cautious in setting goals, according to N. Kalaiselvi, Director, CSIR – Centra
        Electrochemical Research Institute.
        She was delivering the inaugural address at a training programme, ‘Empowerment of rural women by nurturing

        Thanjavur, to
        mark International Women’s Day. <br>
        Ms. Kalaiselvi said the food processing sector offered viable options for women entrepreneurs, which could
        be
        tapped by rural women. <br>
        At the same time, she cautioned the participants to set their goals in such a manner that they achieve them
        without fail.
        In his presidential address, IIFPT Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said out of 97 successful entrepreneurs
        in
        the recent past, 17 were women. He also highlighted the growing participation of women in IIFPT’s skill
        development initiatives. <br>
        Over 1,000 aspiring women took part in the event from across the State. They got acquainted with a wide
        range of
        food processing methods for fruit beverages, jam, jelly, fancy cakes and cookies, value addition of
        traditional
        millets and rice and techniques for fermented food products.
        Food safety and hygiene practices from the industry point of view were also highlighted to the participants,
        according to an IIFPT press release.
