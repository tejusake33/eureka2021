  </div>
  <h2>Traditional Method</h2>
  <div class="right">
    <img src="agri.jpg" alt="" srcset="" >
  </div>
  <h3>Let us check some of the old farming methods in india:</h3>
  <h4 style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">1] PRIMITIVE FARMING :</h4>
  <p>This is the oldest method . It is majorly practiced in small farming lands by using hoe, digging sticks etc. It is
    practiced by those farmers , who use the output for their own consumption. However, farmers still have to depend on
    the heat, soil fertility, and environmental condition. This method is also called the 'Slash and Burn' method where
    once crops are grown, farmers burn the land.</p>
  <h4 style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">2] SUBSISTENCE FARMING: </h4>
  <p>In this subsistence farming in India method, the cultivation takes place across larger land areas, and it is
    labor-intensive. Moreover, for the high-quantity of chemical fertilizer production, different irrigation methods are
    used to help to yield crops.
    Under subsistence farming, there are two types of crops grown- wet and dry. Paddy falls under the wet crop and dry
    crops include- wheat, pulses, and maize.</p>
  <h4 style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">3] COMMERCIAL FARMING: </h4>
  <p>Commercial farming in India involves new techniques and tools, contributing huge to the Indian economy. Crops grown
    under this farming are also exported to other countries. Under commercial farming, farmers use a good amount of
    fertilizers, insecticides, and pesticides that would enhance the growth of crops.
    Under commercial farming, the plantation is also practiced. Plantation farming involves the mixture of agriculture
    and industry, and is widely practiced in vast farming land.
  </p>
  <h3>ADVANTAGES:</h3>
  <p>1]The crops are pure without fertilisers hence ,they can be sold with a higher price as it is pure <br>

    2]The waste of the crops can be used as fertilisers.
  </p>
  <h3>DISADVANTAGES:</h3>
  <p>1]Reduce the Fertility of the Soil. <br>

    2]It takes a long time to harvest .
  </p>
  <h2>Modern Method</h2>
  <div class="right">
    <img src="modern.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="300px" height="150px">
  </div>
  <p>Ⅰ .Use of alternate source of energy. <br>
    Ⅱ . Integrated pest management. Ⅲ .Hydroponic & Aquaponic methods. <br>
    Ⅳ . Crop rotation. <br>
    Ⅴ. Vertical farming. </p>
    <br> <br> 
  <h4 style="color: red;">1] ALTERNATE SOURCE OF ENERGY:</h4>
  <p>-The first and the most important practice is the use alternate source of energy. <br>
    -The use solar , hydro power or wind farms is ecologically friendly. <br>
    -Farmers can use solar panels to store solar energy and use it for electrical fencing and running of pumps and
    heaters. <br>
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: red;">2]INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT:</h4>
  <div class="left">
    <img src="pest.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
  </div>
  <P>-Integrated pest management is combination of pest control techniques for identifying and observing pest in its
    initial state. <br>

    -Targeted pest works best when one need to remove specific pest only. <br>

    -This not only helps you to spray pests on the selected area but will also protect wildlife from getting affected.
    <br>
  </P>
  <br> <br>
  <h4 style="color: red;">3]HYDROPONIC AND AQUAPONIC METHODS:</h4>
  <div class="right">
    <img src="hydro.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
  </div>
  <P>-In Hydroponic system , crops are grown with roots directly in the mineral solution or with the roots into an inert
    medium like gravel or perlite. <br>

    - The Hydroponic system makes the plants spent complete energy in flowering and fruiting and minimizing the plant
    stress on the roots for searching minerals. <br>
  </P>
  <br> <br>
  <h4 style="color: red;">4]CROP ROTATION:</h4>
  <div class="left">
    <img src="crop.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
  </div>
  <P>Crop rotation is a tried and tested method used since ancient farming practices proven to keep the soil healthy and nutritious. Crop rotation has a logical explanation – the crops are picked in a pattern so that the crops planted this season replenish the nutrients and salts from the soil that were absorbed by the previous crop cycle. For example, row crops are planted after grains to balance the used nutrients.</P>
  <br> <br> <br>
  <h4 style="color: red;">4]VERTICAL FARMING</h4>
  <div class="right">
    <img src="verticle.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="350px" height="170px">
  </div>
  <p>-Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. <br>
    -The main advantage of utilizing vertical farming technologies is,<br> the increased crop yield that comes with a smaller unit area of land requirement. <br>
    -It is not affected by any climatic change as it is grown in shelter. <br>
    </p>
    <br> <br> <br>
  <h3>ADVANTAGES OF HYDROPONIC SYSTEM:</h3>
  <div class="right">
    <img src="hh.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400px" height="150px">
  </div>
  <P>-The growth rate of plants grown in the hydroponic system is higher than the plants grown in soil. <br>
    -The hydroponic plant grows 25% faster and gives 30% more yield than soil-grown plants. <br>
    -Hydroponic and Aquaponic system reduces soil and water pollution. <br>
    -Plants are provided with balanced nutrients and pH levels , to raise healthy plants
    Without any imbalances. <br>
    -Plants will be free from fungal and bacterial infections. <br>
    -Does not require any insecticide or pesticides. <br>
    -Aquaponics combines the raising of aquatic animals (such as fish) with the growing of hydroponics. <br> -The water
    containing nutrients resulting from the mineralization of the waste material of aquaculture fish is used to nourish
    the hydroponic plants. <br>
    -After the plants use the water , the water gets purified and re-circulated back into the system to be reused by the
    fish.
